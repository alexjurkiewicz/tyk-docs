**Requirements**

[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) is required to run the following commands. Instructions on how install Tyk Gateway with shell is in the <b>Shell</b> tab.
{{< /note >}}

## Getting Started
1. clone the [tyk-ansible](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible) repositry

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible
```

2. `cd` into the directory
```.bash
$ cd tyk-ansible
```

3. Run initalization script to initialize environment

```bash
$ sh scripts/init.sh
```

4. Modify `hosts.yml` file to update ssh variables to your server(s). You can learn more about the hosts file [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

5. Run ansible-playbook to install `tyk-gateway`

```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -t tyk-gateway
```

## Install Tyk API Gateway on Red Hat

Tyk has it's own signed RPMs in a YUM repository hosted by the kind folks at [packagecloud.io][1], which makes it easy, safe and secure to install a trusted distribution of the Tyk Gateway stack.

This tutorial will run on an [Amazon AWS][2] *Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1* instance. We will install Tyk Gateway with all dependencies stored locally.

We're installing on a `t2.micro` because this is a tutorial, you'll need more RAM and more cores for better performance.

This configuration should also work (with some tweaks) for CentOS.

### Prerequisites

*   Ensure port `8080` is open: this is used in this guide for Gateway traffic (API traffic to be proxied)

### Step 1: Set up YUM Repositories

First, we need to install some software that allows us to use signed packages:
```bash
sudo yum install pygpgme yum-utils wget
```

Next, we need to set up the various repository configurations for Tyk and MongoDB:

### Step 2: Create Tyk Gateway Repository Configuration

Create a file named `/etc/yum.repos.d/tyk_tyk-gateway.repo` that contains the repository configuration below https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/install#manual-rpm:
```bash
[tyk_tyk-gateway]
name=tyk_tyk-gateway
baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/el/7/$basearch
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://keyserver.tyk.io/tyk.io.rpm.signing.key.2020
       https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/gpgkey
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
metadata_expire=300
```

### Step 3: Install EPEL

EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) is a free, community based repository project from Fedora which provides high quality add-on software packages for Linux distribution including RHEL, CentOS, and Scientific Linux. EPEL isn't a part of RHEL/CentOS but it is designed for major Linux distributions. In our case we need it for Redis, run this command to get it. Full instructions available here http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F:
```bash
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum update
```

Finally we'll need to update our local cache, so run:
```bash
sudo yum -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='tyk_tyk-gateway' --enablerepo=epel
```

### Step 4: Install Packages

We're ready to go, you can now install the relevant packages using yum:
```bash
sudo yum install -y redis tyk-gateway
```

*(you may be asked to accept the GPG key for our two repos and when the package installs, hit yes to continue)*

### Step 5: Start Redis

In many cases Redis will not be running, so let's start those:
```bash
sudo service redis start
```

When Tyk is finished installing, it will have installed some init scripts, but it will not be running yet. The next step will be to setup the Gateway – thankfully this can be done with three very simple commands.

## Configure Tyk Gateway with the Dashboard

### Prerequisites

This configuration assumes that you have already installed Tyk Dashboard, and have decided on the domain names for your Dashboard and your Portal. **They must be different**. For testing purposes, it is easiest to add hosts entries to your (and your servers) `/etc/hosts` file.

### Set up Tyk

You can set up the core settings for Tyk Gateway with a single setup script, however for more involved deployments, you will want to provide your own configuration file.

{{< note success >}}
**Note**  

You need to replace `<hostname>` for `--redishost=<hostname>`with your own value to run this script.
{{< /note >}}

```bash
sudo /opt/tyk-gateway/install/setup.sh --dashboard=1 --listenport=8080 --redishost=<hostname> --redisport=6379
```

What we've done here is told the setup script that:

*   `--dashboard=1`: We want to use the Dashboard, since Tyk Gateway gets all it's API Definitions from the Dashboard service, as of v2.3 Tyk will auto-detect the location of the dashboard, we only need to specify that we should use this mode.
*   `--listenport=8080`: Tyk should listen on port 8080 for API traffic.
*   `--redishost=<hostname>`: Use Redis on the hostname: localhost.
*   `--redisport=6379`: Use the default Redis port.

### Starting Tyk

The Tyk Gateway can be started now that it is configured. Use this command to start the Tyk Gateway:
```bash
sudo service tyk-gateway start
```

#### Pro Tip: Domains with Tyk Gateway

Tyk Gateway has full domain support built-in, you can:

*   Set Tyk to listen only on a specific domain for all API traffic.
*   Set an API to listen on a specific domain (e.g. api1.com, api2.com).
*   Split APIs over a domain using a path (e.g. api.com/api1, api.com/api2, moreapis.com/api1, moreapis.com/api2 etc).
*   If you have set a hostname for the Gateway, then all non-domain-bound APIs will be on this hostname + the `listen_path`.
